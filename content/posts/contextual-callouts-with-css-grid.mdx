title: Contextual Callouts with CSS Grid
description: >-
  Using the power of CSS grid, it is now easier than ever to create
  callouts—small paragraphs that sit next to the primary text and offer
  additional information.
tags:
  - css
  - layout

import Figure from "../../src/components/figure";
import GridLayout from "../../static/assets/css-grid-layout.svg";
import GridLayout1 from "../../static/assets/css-grid-layout-1.svg";
import GridLayout2 from "../../static/assets/css-grid-layout-2.svg";
import GridLayout3 from "../../static/assets/css-grid-layout-3.svg";
import GridLayout4 from "../../static/assets/css-grid-layout-4.svg";

At long last, contextual callouts are possible with CSS grid. <dfn>Contextual callouts</dfn> are small paragraphs that sit beside primary text and offer secondary information to a reader. They have long been a feature of books, magazines and other printed materials. I enjoy coming across these small asides while reading, as they add texture and interest to the content.

I've been searching for a while now for a way to bring these to the web with pure CSS. The solutions in the past have typically been fairly messy, requiring complex floats and clearing, or manual absolute positioning. That is changing now, thanks to CSS grid.

## The Grid Markup

Say I’m building a blog post template. First, I’ll need a `header` to contain the title. Then I’ll need the primary blog content, consisting of headings, paragraphs, images, and callouts. First let’s write some semantic markup:

```html
<article class="blog-post">
  <header>
    <h1>Article Heading</h1>
  </header>
  <p>Paragraph text</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Alt text"/>
  </figure>
  <h2>Section Heading</h2>
  <p>Paragraph text</p>
  <aside>
    <p>Callout text</p>
  </aside>
  <p>Paragraph text</p>
</article>
```

The `article` element contains the header and all post content as direct children. This will be important as we apply CSS grid styles to the post. Callouts are written using `aside` elements, perfect for content that is connected tangentially to the rest of the document, and appear in the document directly before the paragraph they are connected to. Note that each `aside` contains a child paragraph of its own.

## Fallback Styling

Next, we’ll apply some basic styles for browsers that don’t yet support CSS grid. We’ll set a max-width of 70 characters using the `ch` unit:

```css
.blog-post {
  max-width: 70ch;
}
```

---

## Using CSS Grid

Now, let's progressively enhance for browsers that *do* support CSS grid using a `@supports` query:

```css
@supports(display: grid) {
  .blog-post {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
    grid-column-gap: 2rem;
  }
}
```

<Figure caption="A basic twelve-column grid.">
  <GridLayout1 />
</Figure>

Now it’s time to start placing content on the grid:

```css
.blog-post header {
  grid-column-start: 3;
  grid-column-end: span 2;
}

.blog-post h2,
.blog-post p,
.blog-post figure {
  grid-column-start: 5;
  grid-column-end: span 4;
}
```

<Figure
  caption="The post header and content placed on the grid. Each post child implicitly creates a new grid row."
>
  <GridLayout2 />
</Figure>

The post header and content now sit next to each other in a row. The callouts are up next:

```css
.blog-post aside {
  position: relative;
  grid-column-start: 3;
  grid-column-end: 5;
}

.blog-post aside p {
  position: absolute;
}
```

<Figure
  caption="The aside element positioned on the grid."
>
  <GridLayout3 />
</Figure>

The asides are now pulled to the left of the paragraph immediately following them, looking exactly like callouts. The paragraphs within each callout have absolute positioning applied so that they don't force the proceeding paragraph down if they are taller than the adjacent content.

## Bonus: Full-Width Figures

I can easily style figures within the post so that they stretch across the full width of the grid container. The rest of the content remains at a narrower width.

```css
.blog-post figure {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
  grid-column-gap: 2rem;
  grid-column-start: 1;
  grid-column-end: -1;
}

.blog-post figure img {
  grid-column-start: 1;
  grid-column-end: -1;
}

.blog-post figure figcaption {
  grid-column-start: 5;
  grid-column-end: span 4;
}
```

<Figure
  caption="A full-width figure, retaining a narrow figcaption."
>
  <GridLayout4 />
</Figure>

The `figure` now spans all 12 columns of the parent grid. I set up a nested grid within the `figure` with the same number of columns and spacing as the parent. This allows me to have the `img` element span the full width, while the `figcaption` is aligned with the narrower post content.
