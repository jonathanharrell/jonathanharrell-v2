Think of how many times you have coded a grid of images with an overlay that appears on hover and displays some sort of text. With the `object-fit` property getting wider support, there is now a clean, semantic way to do this.

<figure>
  <img src="../../assets/semantic-image-overlays.png" alt=""/>
  <figcaption>The article element contains two absolutely positioned children: an image and a div with text.</figcaption>
</figure>

## The Old Way (without object-fit)

Here’s how I used to accomplish this:

```html
<article class="blog-post-teaser">
  <div class="image" style="background-image: url(...)"></div>
  <div class="overlay">
    <h3>
      <a href="...">Article Title</a>
    </h3>
  </div>
</article>
```

The markup involved an `article` containing a `div` with a background image applied, and an overlay `div` that contained the text that needed to sit on top of the image. I would then absolutely position both the image and the overlay. The size of the `div` would be determined by a percentage padding trick on the article:

```css
.blog-post-teaser {
  position: relative;
  padding: 30% 0;
}

.blog-post-teaser .image {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}

.blog-post-teaser .overlay {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```

The key downside with this approach is that it's not as semantic as it could be. The image for each article seems like a pretty important piece of content, and the browser doesn’t know that it’s an image. And we can’t feed in `alt` tags to help with SEO.

How do we improve semantics while retaining control of the image sizing? Enter `object-fit`.

## The New Way (with object-fit)

Here’s what my markup looks like now:

```html
<article class="blog-post-teaser">
  <img src="..." alt="...">
  <div class="overlay">
    <h3>
      <a href="...">Article Title</a>
    </h3>
  </div>
</article>
```

Now the browser knows we’re serving up an image. Search engines can properly access alternative text. Let’s look at the styling:

```css
.blog-post-teaser {
  position: relative;
  padding: 30% 0;
}

.blog-post-teaser img {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}

.blog-post-teaser .overlay {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```

It’s almost identical, only that now we’re using the `img` element and applying the `object-fit` property. This works the exact same way as setting `background-size: cover`. The image will fill the specified space.

## Browser Support of object-fit

Currently `object-fit` is not supported in IE or Edge, but there is a [simple polyfill](https://medium.com/@primozcigler/neat-trick-for-css-object-fit-fallback-on-edge-and-other-browsers-afbc53bbb2c3) you can use to convert the image to a background-image in those browsers.
